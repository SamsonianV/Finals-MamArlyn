Description: 
I made a simple frontend yet quite complex backend program that keeps record of all the equipments to borrow, the elements like the client and equipments are added directly in the mysql so in the website itself, you can only access them through dropdowns. With few error handling like Blank Fields alert.



Softwares used:
MySQL Workbench 8.0
Visual Studio - ASP.NET CORE WEB API

Challenges:
> its so hard to connect the database to the front end.


> had errors like dropdowns showing nothing or undefined even though the tables are working completely fine


> debugging the entire system
